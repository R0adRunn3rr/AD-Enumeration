**AD Enumeration**

These script assists with enumeration and misconfiguration identification performed during an internal penetration test (assumed breach scenario) from an unauthenticated or authenticated perspective. 
This is by no means an exhaustive list of enumeration steps to perform, but automates a lot of steps I perform on each engagement and the intention of these scripts was to make the testing process more efficient & work on my scripting abilities. 
There may be tweaks and improvements that can be made!

**Scripts Overview**
